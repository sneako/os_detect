# OsDetect

A simple, fast user-agent parsing library based on BrowserScope's UA database.

This started as a fork of beam-community/ua_parser, stripped down to only
return the operating system family.

It is much faster than other user agent parsing libraries because it users
binary pattern matching for many common cases, and it *only* returns the
operating system name where as other libraries tend to be purely regex based
and return much more information.

## Installation

Add `os_detect` to your `mix.exs` dependencies:

```elixir
def deps do
  [
    {:os_detect, "~> 0.1.0"}
  ]
end
```

## Usage

```elixir
iex> ua = OsDetect.parse("Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; U; Intel Mac OS X 10_5_7; en-us) AppleWebKit/530.17 (KHTML, like Gecko) Version/4.0 Safari/530.17 Skyfire/2.0")
"macos"
```
